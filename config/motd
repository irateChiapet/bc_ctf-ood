# 🚩 Welcome to the CTF Challenge! 🚩

**Greetings, Digital Warriors!**

Welcome to our Capture The Flag competition! Whether you're a seasoned security professional or a curious beginner, you're about to embark on an exciting journey through the world of cybersecurity challenges.

## 🎯 What is CTF?

Capture The Flag is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve security-related challenges to find hidden "flags" - typically strings in a specific format like `flag{example_flag_here}`. Each solved challenge earns you points, and the goal is to capture as many flags as possible!

## 📋 Competition Rules

- **Ask Questions**: Our organizers and mentors are here to help guide you
- **Have Fun**: Remember, this is about learning and growing your skills!

### ❌ **DON'T:**
